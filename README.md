## Description

This project is a command-line application designed to automate the creation of professional README.md files for new projects. It uses Node.js and the Inquirer package to prompt the user for information about their project, including details such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, chosen license, GitHub username, and email address. The README generator then dynamically generates a README.md file based on this input, structured with sections like Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. It also includes a badge for the chosen license near the top of the README and provides links to the user's GitHub profile and contact email within the Questions section. This tool aims to streamline the process of creating consistent and informative project documentation, ensuring that developers can quickly generate README files that meet professional standards and include essential project details.
